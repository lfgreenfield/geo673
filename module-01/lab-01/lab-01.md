# lab 01: Making a Choropleth Map with Leaflet

**Instructions:** Examine the contents of the *lab-01/lab-01-data/* directory. This directory includes a starter template *index.html* page, a *ky_counties_housing.json* data file, and a metadata file *ky_counties_housing.txt*.

Modify the *index.html* to fulfill the requirements listed below. 

The goal of this lab is to create a dynamically generated choropleth map in Leaflet with an accompanying legend. To achieve this, follow the instructions in the Lesson 01, modifying the *lab-01/ab-01-data/index.html* file as you go. Beyond the map described in Module 01, your map should also achieve the following:

1. Represent a normalized data attribute other than the "OWNED_MORT" used in the Lesson 01 example (refer to the metadata file *ky_counties_housing.txt* for a description of data property names).
2. Include a popup triggered when a user clicks on a county. The popup should display the name of the county, the attribute being mapped, and the value of that attribute for that county. For example:

![Example of popup](lab-01-graphics/popup.png)

Save your changes to your *index.html* file and **commit changes to your local GitHub repository** as you work.
